![max-tech-shop](src/assets/max-tech-shop-icon.png)

A fake e-commerce about tech and gaming products, designed and buided with a Javascript library React.js for education purpose.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation

I want to become an excellent front-end web developer and React.js is the main one library that I would like to learn and specialize. 

## Features

MAX-TECH-SHOP App is able to show a list of products by category and details like a real e-commerce place. This web app is a SPA that can be navigated with links that let you go to other views, also is possible add to cart a quantity of products and carry out a complete purchase process, ending with an ID number confirmation. The app is back-end less thanks to firebase where it fetch the products information and upload the purchase information.
